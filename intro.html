        I am a big Mirza Ghalib fan, I love his shayari, so always try to write something which is similar to Ghalibs shayari but have not written by anyone. I always beleive whatever is yours always stays to you and it will be always special for you. Through this blog i just want to create a good collection with some of sweet and special shayris. Most of the shayris i have dedicated to my beloved husband Abhijit. Because whenever i see him shayris starts forming in my mind, all the emotions comes through words and those get fit into the Shayaris.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Why to do this?</h2>
    <p>
        To have something where i can have my shayris stored and anyone or i can go and read or update them anytime.
    <br>
        I will keep posting the shayris based on my mood. Sometimes funny, some times lovely sometimes full of sorrow and sometimes as a break up. So reader will always fall in one of category and enjoy the collection.
